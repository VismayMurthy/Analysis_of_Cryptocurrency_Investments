# Analysis_of_Cryptocurrency_Investments
Cryptocurrency is playing an increasingly important role in reshaping the financial system due to 
its growing popular appeal and merchant acceptance. most of the people are making investments 
in Cryptocurrency, the dynamical features, uncertainty, the predictability of Cryptocurrency are 
still mostly unknown, which dramatically risk the investments. It is a matter to try to understand 
the factors that influence value formation. In this study, we use advanced artificial intelligence 
frameworks of fully connected random forest regression, elastic net, basian regress the price 
dynamics of Bitcoin, Etherum, and Ripple. We are going to implement this algorithm for 
predicting the result for the next 30 days. The objective of this project is to predict the 30-days 
price of the most popular cryptocurrencies given their historical variations. To achieve this, several 
regression techniques are explored. In the end, Gradient Boosting Regressor yields the best 
prediction result for Ripple, and ExtraTrees Regressor performs the best for the rest of 
cryptocurrencies.
